# Chrome extension to automatically convert imperial units to metric

This chrome extension will try to find imperial units on websites, and convert them to metric units, and insert the converted value directly on the site.

The plugin is available for install on the chrome webstore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/automatic-imperial-to-met/ggidgjeiboeedjjabheimgdkolnpaoik).

See example below:
